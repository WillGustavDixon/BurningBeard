# The Burning Beard: COMP3150 Game Design Project

## Inventory System

Early-stage design of how the inventory system should function, with item placement and organisation.
Items, including their names, value and grid space, are specified in the ItemData.json file, which can be iterated upon as more items are designed.

### Controls

- Left Mouse Button: Place/Pick up item
- Right Mouse Button: View item information
- Scroll Wheel Up/Down: Rotate item

### TO DO

 - Try to get the cursor to anchor to the top left of the item, rather than the centre, so that it's more clear where the item will go when placed.
